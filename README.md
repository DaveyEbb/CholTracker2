# CholTracker2
App to track blood test results and track progress on cholesterol readings.
The readings are complicated to understand and track, particularly when it comes to tracking progress
over time on 'good' cholesterol and 'bad' cholesterol levels.  

The app allows blood test results to be recorded and then shows the 4 levels on a graph, where it's 
easy to see improvemnent or otherwise - 'good' cholesterol is shown with a green libe, 'bad' cholesterol 
with a red line.
User authentication is included, based on the user's email address with password protection, so that 
results can be retained across sessions and devices.

Data is stored in the cloud, using Google's Firebase for 'Mobile-back-end-as-a-service'. 
The app is built using hybrid
technologies - Angluar2 and Ionic2 - so that android, iOS and Windows Mobile apps can be created from a
single code base.
